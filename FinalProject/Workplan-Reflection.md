We managed to stay on schedule throughout the project, but it took a bit longer per day than we had initially estimated. Our daily meetings prior to the midpoint checkin lasted anywhere from 3-4 hours each. Later on, our more complex tests revealed some problems in our architecture, leading to a couple 6+ hour meetings. Overall, we overshot our time estimates by a few hours, but managed to meet all of our daily goals which led to an on-time completion and plenty of time for analysis/debugging.
