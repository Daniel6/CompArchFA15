Tues, Dec 1, 9PM Instruction memory (32*n bits VLIW) -> 1 Hour 
Tues, Dec 1, Unit testing. -> 1 Hour


Wed, Dec 2, 4-5PM Decoder -> four decoders in a row. #yolo 1 hour
Wed, Dec 2, 4-5PM Unit testing. 1 hour


Thurs, Dec 3, 3:10-4:30 PM Regfile -> should… be good? double the size of it. (triple?) 1 Hour
Thurs, Dec 3, 3:10-4:30 PM Unit testing. 1 Hour


Fri, Dec 4, 3:10-4:30 PM Core -> mips cpu -> (should be good? -> extend lab3 instruction) 1.5 H
Fri, Dec 4, 3:10-4:30 PM Unit testing. 1.5 Hours


Sat, Dec 5, 1-2:30 PM Data memory -> needs to be addressed by everything at all times. 1.5 H
Sat, Dec 5, 1-2:30 PM Unit testing. 1.5 Hours


Sun, Dec 6, 12:30-1:30 PM Merging.
Sun, Dec 6, 12:30-1:30 PM Integration test/programs -> by hands + no compiler :(
(1)0 Hours. We be aight. Debugging.

Mon, Dec 7, Midpoint Check -> 
        We will have a functional multi core processing module for VLIW instructions. Ideally able to run simple programs. 


(1)0 Hours. Additional Debugging. 
Mon, Dec 7, 9-10:30 PM Analysis on Different Programs. 1.5 hours.
Tues, Dec 8,  9-10:30 PM More Analysis.  1.5 Hours
Documentation for individual modules done




Stretch Goals:
Addressing more than 32 Registers (requires new ISA, longer register addresses)
Scheduling. (For minimizing data hazards automatically, simplifying structures)
Add SIMD type instructions. (ala add 5 automatically; would maybe need private registers/caches)






Problems to think/ignore/push to software:
Data hazards.
