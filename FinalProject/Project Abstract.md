DO MORE WITH ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED! WITH OUR PATENTED MULTI-CORE TECHNOLOGY, COMPUTERS CAN DO MANY THINGS AT ONCE!

Most modern computers use multi-core technology to process tasks faster. Traditionally, single core computers can only execute one instruction at a time such ass "add" "subtract" or "save value to memory." With a multi-core processor, you can execute as many instructions as you want at t he same time, only limited by the number of cores that you have. In a perfect world, a processor with 4 cores would ba able to do things four times as fast as a processor with only 1 core. Unfortunately, a lot of the time you can't do more than one instruction at the same time. For example, when one "add" instruction is adding the result of the previous "add" instruction with something, these two instructions cannot be executed at the same time. This problem is known as "instruction parallelism."
