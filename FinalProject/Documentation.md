### What programs run faster
#### String Reversal
Reverse the order of characters in a string of length n stored in memory

- 1-core: 								6 + 9(n/2-1) + 8 cycles
- 2-core: 								3 + 5(n/2) cycles
- 4-core: 								2 + 4(n/2) cycles
- 4-core (w/ multi-core optimization): 	3 + 3(n/2) cycles or 4 cycles if string is 1 char or less

Eg: n=8

- 1-core: 							 41 cycles (100% speed)
- 2-core: 							 23 cycles (178%)
- 4-core: 							 18 cycles (228%)
- 4-core (w/ multi-core optimization): 15 cycles (273%)

Eg: n=3

- 1-core: 							 14 cycles (100% speed)
- 2-core: 							 8 cycles  (175%)
- 4-core: 							 6 cycles  (233%)
- 4-core (w/ multi-core optimization): 4 cycles  (350%)

Eg: n=27
- 1-core: 							 122 cycles (100% speed)
- 2-core: 							 68 cycles  (179%)
- 4-core: 							 54 cycles  (226%)
- 4-core (w/ multi-core optimization): 42 cycles  (286%)

#### Division

Compute integer division with a remainder

1-core: 7 + 4*(a/b)
2-core: 5 + 3*(a/b)
4-core: 4 + 3*(a/b)

Eg. a=5, b=2
1-core: 15 cycles (100% speed)
2-core: 11 cycles (127%)
4-core: 10 cycles (133%)

Eg. a=100, b=1
1-core: 407 cycles (100% speed)
2-core: 305 cycles (125%)
4-core: 304 cycles (125%)

Eg. a=0, b=2
1-core: 7 cycles (100% speed)
2-core: 5 cycles (129%)
4-core: 4 cycles (143%)

#### Array Sorting
Use bubble sort to sort the array [14, 12, 13, 5, 9, 11, 3, 7, 10] stored in memory from highest to lowest.

- 1-core: 388 cycles (100% speed)
- 4-core: 297 cycles

#### Multiply
Multiplies two variables in memory.

- 1-Core: 34 Cycles
- 4-Core: 17 Cycles

#### Linear Search
Searches for a list for a given number. Stores the index of where the number was found.

- 1-Core: 5 + 4*(N/2) cycles on average
- 2-Core: 4 + 2*(N/2) cycles on average
- 4-Core: 3 + 2*(N/8) cycles on average

Eg. Search for 5 in list of 1-10
- 1-Core: 23 cycles
- 2-Core: 14 cycles
- 4-Core: 7 cycles

## CPU Instruction Tests

The CPU was tested to perform a set of inidividual MIPS ISA instructions properly. The list of operations that the CPU can perform are as follows:

* LW
* SW
* J
* JR
* JAL
* BNE
* BEQ
* XORI
* ADD
* SUB
* SLT

For each of these instructions, the CPU performed the desired operation on all four cores in parallel. After each of these fundamental operations executed properly, larger programs could be built using many instructions simultaneously.
